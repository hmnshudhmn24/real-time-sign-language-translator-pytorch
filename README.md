# 🧠 Real-Time Sign Language Translator (PyTorch + OpenCV)

A fully working, real-time sign language translator that uses your webcam to detect hand signs (A-Z) and translates them into English letters using a custom-trained CNN model. Built with PyTorch, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Tkinter for a live GUI interface.

## 📖 Project Description

This project aims to make communication more inclusive for people with hearing or speech impairments. By using a webcam and real-time hand gesture detection, it provides instant feedback in the form of English letters based on American Sign Language (ASL). It's an innovative blend of AI, computer vision, and accessibility.
